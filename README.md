You can log in as a normal user (first you have to register)
or as an admin (admin/admin are the credentials).

If The google pay button does not work make sure you are logged in with google
in the device settings.

If there are room database issues please clear the cache and the data directly 
from the application settings on the device you are using.

Lastly, if nothing works, please try to emulate the application on the same phone I did, which
was Pixel 4 API 25 @Android 7.1.1
